Team Assignment 10
Due Date: Friday, August 10, 7:00 PM (No late submissions accepted)

Submit the java file named Vowels.java with the static method named numOfVowels such that

The method takes only a single parameter: a string
The method returns an int -> the number of vowels in the parameter (ignoring 'y')
There are no variables defined outside of a method.
numOfVowels is recursive
A JUnit test is provided below.  Make sure your code does not contain the words 'for' or 'while' anywhere: including inside documentation or as substrings.

If the implementation is not recursive, your submission is not worth any mark: you will be assigned 0 marks for this assignment.

In the in-line documentation in your code indicate

The terminating condition and explain that the terminating conditions will always be reached eventually.
The recursive call(s) and why this brings us closer to the terminating condition.
How the result of the recursive call is used to compute the required solution. Explain why this computation is correct. You may assume that the recursive call gives a correct solution for the sub-problem.
