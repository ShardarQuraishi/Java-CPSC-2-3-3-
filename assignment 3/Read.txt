Team Assignment 3
Topic: Encapsulation and object references

Due Date: Tuesday July 17 3:00 PM (No late submissions accepted)

Requirements:

First, ensure that your BankAccount class from the previous week meets the specifications of Assignment 2. Consult an instructor during office hours, or a TA during CT if you need additional assistance.

Create a Customer class with the following:

Instance variables with appropriate getter and setter methods: name, which is a string, and a customerID, which is an integer.
A toString() method which provides a well-formatted string representation of the instance variables in the Customer class.
Appropriate constructors for the class: a default constructor which takes no arguments, a constructor which takes in a name and an ID number, as well as a copy constructor
Add an instance of the Customer class to your BankAccount class, as an instance variable with a getter method.

Update BankAccount with appropriate constructors, which can take in an object of the class Customer as a parameter.

Both Customer and BankAccount should pass the tests provided here, and be able to successfully run the code below.

Provide a trace for the following code:

Customer c1 = new Customer("Alison Brown", 123);
BankAccount b1 = new BankAccount(c1, 100.00);

Customer c2 = b1.getCustomer();
c2.setName("Charles Green");
System.out.println(c1);
System.out.println(c2);

Customer c3 = c1;
c3.setName("Eva White");
System.out.println(b1.getCustomer());
System.out.println(c3);
